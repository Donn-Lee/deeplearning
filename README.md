# IEOR 4720: Deep Learning
Team B1: Tiffany Soebijantoro, Donghao Li

In this project, we seek to identify which patients have Alzheimer’s Disease based on their brain MRI scans, age, and gender data. We will do so using a 3D CNN model and training it on 6,211 data points. Our model should be able to classify a patient’s diagnosis based on their MRI scan, age, and gender. Our code base is in Python, using NumPy and Pandas to help with data preprocessing, Scipy and Nibabel to process MRI scans, and Tensorflow for the CNN model.
